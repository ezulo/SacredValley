Event is a container for data that gets passed between classes whenever an
event occurs. Off the top of my head, example event types and their metadata:
	* User Input
		- Involved key
		- Boolean for press, release
	* Game State Change (push or pull)
		- Boolean flag to push or pull
		- Game state to push if true
	* A temporal event occurring
		- An attached handler pointing to a method (?)
	* Object collision occuring
		- The two object instances, math passed on to collision engine if
		  StateMgr has one
For now handle User Input and Game State Change events. Others are dependent
on further work being done.

Challenges:
	* StateMgr and GameStates must have capability to interpret EventType enum, 
	  change flow of control accordingly
